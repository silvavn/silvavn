## Dev Profile

I'm a PhD Student at the University of Alberta, Canada. My main development interests are around Machine Learning and Finance. I have experience in all major areas of Software Engineering, including documentation, testing, front-end, and back-end development.

## Highlights

- I contribute and/or maintain open source, including [scholarly](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly), [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [Eiten](https://github.com/tradytics/eiten), and [Freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade)
- I've done (and sometimes still do) reverse engineering of APIs and closed source code
- My favourite technologies/languages are Python, Vue and Javascript, but I love to try new technologies every now and then.

## Research Profile

I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence with focus on data driven Approaches. My current research covers the detection, representation and evaluation of "change" in data. That means that I am curious about:

- Whether the characteristics of the data and/or its data points are different at different points in time; (Change, as the result)
- The process that makes data characteristics be different at different time points (Change, as in, the process of change).
I conduct research under supervision of Dr. Joerg Sander and Dr. Eleni Stroulia.

I am also curious about: Financial Machine Learning, Ethics, Democracy and Philosophy.

In the past I did research on game AI, including intelligent agents, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and human-computer interaction.

## A third person summary

Victor is a PhD student in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, under the supervision of Dr. Joerg Sander and Dr. Eleni Stroulia. His research lies broadly in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on detection of Change in Data Mining and Machine Learning. Victor  is also interested in: Financial Machine Learning, Time-Series Analysis, Ethics, Fairness and Bias in Machine Learning.

He holds a M.Sc. in Computing Science from the University of Alberta, a M. Sc. in Computer Science from UFMG and a degree in Game Development from PUC Minas. At the University of Alberta, he was supervised by Dr. Joerg Sander, under whom he researched Unsupervised Learning and Cluster Evolution. At UFMG he was supervised by Dr. Luiz Chaimowicz, under whom he researched Intelligent Agents, with a special focus on Computer Games. He has published both journal and conference papers as well as a book and book chapters.
